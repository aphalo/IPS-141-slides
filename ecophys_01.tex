\section{Why \emph{sensory and physiological ecology}?}
\nocite{Dusenbery1992,Taiz2014}
\begin{frame}{Changing perspective in Biology + \Discussion}
  \begin{description}
    \item[Era: Industrial revolution] Organisms studied as mechanical machines. Chemistry and Physics provide mechanisms.
    \item[Era: Information revolution] Organisms viewed as processors of information. We add a new layer of explanation on top of earlier ones.
    \item[Animals vs.\ plants] The role of information in animals was recognized earlier than in plants.
    \item[\DiscussionI] Examples?
  \end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Physiology vs.\ ecology (typical definitions)}
    \textbf{Plant physiology} is the study of the function,
    or physiology, of plants. Fundamental processes such as
    photosynthesis, respiration, plant nutrition, water
    relations, and development are studied by plant physiologists.\\[2ex]

    \textbf{Plant ecology} is the study of the factors affecting the distribution and abundance
    of plants. It aims to show how pattern and structure at
    different levels of organization are influenced by abiotic
    factors (e.g.\ climate and soil) and biotic interactions
    (e.g.\ competition, facilitation, symbiosis and parasitism)
    \\  \vspace{\stretch{1}}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Physiological ecology and Stress physiology}
    \nocite{Lambers2008,Lambers2019}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Viewpoint: plants as ``victims'' of the environment.
        \item \emph{Physiological ecology $\approx$ ecophysiology} seeks to describe the
        \textbf{physiological mechanisms} that underlie ecological
        observations.
        \item \emph{Stress physiology} differs only by its focus on extreme environmental conditions instead of all conditions.
        \item \emph{Ecophysiologists address ecological questions about
        the controls over growth, reproduction, survival, abundance,
        and geographical distribution of plants as these processes
        are affected by the ``mass + energy'' exchange between plants and their physical, chemical, and biotic environment.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sensory ecology}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Viewpoint: plants as ``navigators'' in the environment.
        \item Sensory ecology studies the \textbf{mechanisms of information acquisition and emission} that underlie ecological observations.
        \item \emph{Sensory ecologists address ecological questions about
        the controls over growth, reproduction, survival, abundance,
        and geographical distribution of plants as these processes
        are affected by the ``information'' exchange between plants and their physical, chemical, and biotic environment.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fitness and evolution}
    \Attention ``Nothing makes sense in Biology except in the light of evolution''

    \vspace{0.5ex}
       \emph{Fitness} is ``measured'' as the success in producing viable offspring (passing genes to the next generation).

       The organisms we study are the result of the \emph{evolutionary process}. To understand why organisms have the functions, morphology, life cycle and behaviour they have, we need to take into account how these features contribute to fitness.

       These functions include both sensing leading to development ``decisions'' and regulation of metabolism and growth supporting reproduction and/or multiplication, and thus fitness.

        \item<1,4> Most \textbf{crops} have been under artificial selection for a

\section{About the course}

\begin{frame}{Learning objectives (in brief)}
    Are that at the end of this course:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Learn the language of sensory and physiological ecology of plants.
    \item Learn the basic "workings" of plants and how they have adapted and how they can acclimate to environment.
    \item Learn concepts and a way of looking at plants based on the current scientific ideas.
    \item Learn how to find answers to questions about acclimation and adaptation of plants through experiments.
    \item Learn how to find, interpret and use information to solve problems and answer questions related to plant ecology.
    \item However, you will \textbf{not} have to memorize detailed information that is available in books, journals or the internet.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Contents of the course}
More details available in Moodle. All the points listed below are discussed emphasising acclimation and adaptation.
\begin{itemize}
   \item Introduction
   \item The shared environment of plants
   \item Sensory biology
   \item Adaptation and acclimation of carbon and energy metabolism
   \item Adaptation and acclimation of water uptake and loss
   \item Adaptation and acclimation to mineral nutrient supply
   \item Adaption and acclimation of morphology and anatomy
   \item Plasticity in a changing or artificial habitat
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Understanding vs.\ memorization}

  \begin{alertblock}{Teaching and learning}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The role of examples (in this course and elsewhere) is to make a concept tangible\ldots
      \item \ldots easier to grasp than a purely abstract idea.
      \item When studying focus on the concepts\ldots
      \item \ldots once you grasp a concept, or learn the idea\ldots
      \item \ldots you will be able to find or make up another suitable example when needed.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{alertblock}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Examples}

\begin{itemize}
  \item I will use examples from both wild species and cultivated species. Mostly higher plants from terrestrial environments.
  \item In recent years physiological research has made frequent use of \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana}.
  \item \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana} is a useful model, but the variation in the plant kingdom is enormous: in size, shape, function, growth rate, and lifespan.
  \item This variation is the result, at least in part, of variation in past and current growth environments.
  \item Natural selection is constrained by evolutionary history.
  \item Random events also play a role, especially in small populations.
\end{itemize}
