\section{Why \emph{sensory and physiological ecology}?}

\begin{frame}{Changing perspective in Biology + \Discussion}
  \begin{description}
    \item[Era: Industrial revolution] Organisms studied as mechanical machines. Chemistry and Physics provide mechanisms.
    \item[Era: Information revolution] Organisms viewed as processors of information. We add a new layer of explanation on top of earlier ones.
    \item[Animals vs.\ plants] The role of information in animals was recognized earlier than in plants.
    \item[\DiscussionI] Examples?
  \end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Physiology vs.\ ecology (typical definitions)}
    \textbf{Plant physiology} is the study of the function,
    or physiology, of plants. Fundamental processes such as
    photosynthesis, respiration, plant nutrition, water
    relations, and development are studied by plant physiologists.\\[2ex]

    \textbf{Plant ecology} is the study of the factors affecting the distribution and abundance
    of plants. It aims to show how pattern and structure at
    different levels of organization are influenced by abiotic
    factors (e.g.\ climate and soil) and biotic interactions
    (e.g.\ competition, facilitation, symbiosis and parasitism)
    \\  \vspace{\stretch{1}}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ecology's subdisciplines}
    \Attention Boundaries can be fuzzy!

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\blacktriangleright$] \emph{Physiological ecology} and
        Behavioural ecology examine adaptations of the individual
        to its environment.
        \item[$\blacktriangleright$] \emph{Sensory ecology} studies how individuals acquire, process, and respond to information from their environment.
        \item[$\blacktriangleright$] \emph{Evolutionary ecology} explicitly considers the evolutionary histories of species.
        \item[$\vartriangleright$] \emph{Population ecology (or autecology)} studies the dynamics of populations of a single species.
        \item[$\vartriangleright$] \emph{Community ecology (or synecology)} focuses on the interactions between species within a community.
        \item[$\vartriangleright$] \emph{Ecosystem ecology} studies the flows of energy and matter through the biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems.
        \item[$\vartriangleright$] \emph{Landscape ecology} examines processes and relationships across multiple ecosystems or very large geographic areas.
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Physiological ecology/Stress physiology}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Viewpoint: plants as ``victims'' of the environment.
        \item \emph{Physiological ecology $\approx$ ecophysiology} seeks to describe the
        \textbf{physiological mechanisms} that underlie ecological
        observations.
        \item \emph{Stress physiology} differs only by its focus on extreme environmental conditions instead of all conditions.
        \item \emph{Ecophysiologists address ecological questions about
        the controls over growth, reproduction, survival, abundance,
        and geographical distribution of plants as these processes
        are affected by the ``mass + energy'' exchange between plants and their
        physical, chemical, and biotic environment.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sensory ecology}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Viewpoint: plants as ``navigators'' in the environment.
        \item Sensory ecology studies the \textbf{mechanisms of information acquisition and emission}
        that underlie ecological observations.
        \item \emph{Sensory ecologists address ecological questions about
        the controls over growth, reproduction, survival, abundance,
        and geographical distribution of plants as these processes
        are affected by the ``information'' exchange between plants and their
        physical, chemical, and biotic environment.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fitness and evolution}
    \Attention ``Nothing makes sense in Biology except in the light of evolution''

    \vspace{0.5ex}
       \emph{Fitness} is ``measured'' as the success in producing viable offspring (passing genes to the next generation).

       The organisms we study are the result of the \emph{evolutionary process}. To understand why organisms have the functions, morphology, life cycle and behaviour they have, we need to take into account how these features contribute to fitness.

       These functions include both sensing leading to development ``decisions'' and regulation of metabolism and growth supporting reproduction and/or multiplication, and thus fitness.

      \item What is the role of natural selection in crop breeding?
      \item Chose a crop you are familiar to explain your answers.

\begin{frame}{Wild plants vs.\ weeds vs.\ crops \Discussion}
    \begin{itemize}

        \item<1,4> Most \textbf{crops} have been under artificial selection for a
        long time. Farmers and breeders have selected the most useful
        genotypes.

        \item[{\small +}]<1,4> In addition natural selection is also active on cultivated plants,
        although in a managed environment. \DExamples

        \item[{\small --}]<1,4> Most crops have very low fitness in the wild. \DExamples

        \item<2,4> Crop \textbf{weeds} are not subject to artificial selection,
        they are under natural selection but in a managed environment. \DExamples

        \item<3,4> Natural selection in most populations of \textbf{wild plants} is affected by human activities. \DExamples
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Adaptation vs.\ acclimation}

\begin{description}
\item[Adaptation] Genetic variation + natural selection. It takes place
over more than one generation. \textit{There is change in the
genotype}.

\item[Acclimation] Regulation within the lifetime of an individual, it
involves changes in the phenotype in response to the environment.
\textit{There is no change in the genotype}.

    Are that at the end of this course:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Learn the language of sensory and physiological ecology of plants.
    \item Learn the basic "workings" of plants and how they have adapted and how they can acclimate to environment.
    \item Learn concepts and a way of looking at plants based on the current scientific ideas.
    \item Learn how to find answers to questions about acclimation and adaptation of plants through experiments.
    \item Learn how to find, interpret and use information to solve problems and answer questions related to plant ecology.
    \item However, you will \textbf{not} have to memorize detailed information that is available in books, journals or the internet.
