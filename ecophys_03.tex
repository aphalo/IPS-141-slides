\section{Hierarchy and scale}
\nocite{Allen1982}

\begin{frame}{Levels of organization}
An example of a hierarchy is the hierarchy of levels of organization

Ecosystem $\rightarrow$\\
\hspace{.5cm}Community $\rightarrow$\\
\hspace{1cm}Population $\rightarrow$\\
\hspace{1.5cm}Individual $\rightarrow$\\
\hspace{2cm}Organ $\rightarrow$\\
\hspace{2.5cm}Tissue $\rightarrow$\\
\hspace{3cm}Cell $\rightarrow$\\
\hspace{3.5cm}Organelle $\rightarrow$\\
\hspace{4cm}Molecule $\rightarrow$\\
\hspace{4.5cm}Atom $\rightarrow$\\
\hspace{5cm}Subatomic particle

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Scale}
    \begin{description}[type=1]
        \item[Temporal scale] Fast physiological
        responses, acclimation, and adaptation happen at
        different temporal scales. The processes involved are
        different.
        \item[Spatial scale] For example when
        studying transpiration, we can do it at different
        scales: the leaf, the tree crown, the forest, etc.
        The main controlling environmental variables may
        be different.

\begin{frame}{Mechanism and `reason' (=justification)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Upward and downward causation} in biology.
        \item We achieve a \emph{mechanistic explanation} for an
        observed phenomenon by studying the levels below.
        e.g. We study whole plant growth in two different habitats.
        We build a mechanistic
        explanation from the growth and responses of individual
        organs: leaves, stems, roots.

        \item We build a \emph{narrative explanation} for the phenomenon
        by looking at the levels above.
        e.g. In this example we find a reason or justification for
        the differences based on natural selection, but we do not study
        the evolutionary process itself.

        \item Of course we can set the focus at any level in the hierarchy and what is mechanism or narrative explanation will move along.~\DExamples

\item Plant behaviour $\rightarrow$ \textcolor{green}{strong evidence}
\item Plant intelligence $\rightarrow$ \textcolor{yellow}{depends on definition}

\section{A different controversy}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The need for context awareness}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{I exclude here the controversy about GMO themselves.}
\item Genetic manipulation has worked for breeding simple traits $\rightarrow$ \textcolor{green}{no controversy}
\item Genetic manipulation has worked for complex traits $\rightarrow$ \textcolor{orange}{strong controversy}
\item To an agronomist producing a GMO crop genotype with more efficient photosynthetic metabolism is a success only if it results \emph{in a cultivar with improved performance in farms}.
\item That some molecular biologists consider/``sell'' such a result on photosynthesis as a breakthrough towards ending famine or some similar major goal can deeply upset most agronomists\ldots
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is the evidence}
\begin{itemize}
\item Genetic manipulation has worked for breeding simple traits $\rightarrow$ \textcolor{green}{strong evidence}
\item Genetic manipulation has worked for complex traits $\rightarrow$ \textcolor{orange}{one or two isolated ``special cases'' out of very many attempts}
\item In my view the problem is not in GM as a method, it is in not understanding that improvement in a trait like photosynthesis rate is almost never directly reflected in yield
\item An organism is like a choir, if a single singer starts singing louder than others, it makes the performance of the choir worse rather than better, unless the singer is a solist\ldots

\begin{frame}{Talk by Ariel Novoplansky \Video}

Observation without preconceptions plus theory are important when developing new hypotheses\ldots

\begin{frame}{Next steps \Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item By now I expect you and me to share enough of a language and frame of mind to discuss without misunderstandings.
  \item If some ideas remain unclear, do ask at any time.
  \item If we had enough time we have watched the video of the TEDx talk by Prof.\ Ariel Novoplansky, but if not please watch it at home. Discuss about it in the corresponding Moodle forum. Remember that discussion can include what implications the phenomena described may have in a question of your own interest, how watching the talk may have changed your views about plants, questions about something that you did not understand, or something that you would like to criticize.

%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item Consider a plant you have at home (or another specific individual plant).
%  \item Write a list of the factors in its environment that vary through the day.
%  \item Consider the environment of roots, leaves and stems of this plant.
%  \item Consider what properties of these factors are most and least important to the growth of your plant.
