%\begin{frame}{Discussion}{One question per pair of students (10 min), whole class (10 min)}
%  After listening to this lecture, what would you think if someone told you that:
%  \begin{itemize}
%    \item plants display behaviour?
%    \item plants can learn?
%    \item plants can perceive their environment?
%    \item plants can solve problems?
%    \item plants have intelligence?
%    \item how does this affect crop breeding and management?
%    \item how could this affect ecosystem response to climate change?
